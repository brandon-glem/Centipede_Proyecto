Description:
It was one of the most commercially successful games from the video arcade's golden age. The player fights off centipedes, spiders, scorpions and fleas, completing a round after eliminating the centipede that winds down the playing field.
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Installation:
All you will need is to install Allegro which is a Codelock`s library. You can get this library on its own website and it will not take you more than 15 minutes to install it. 
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Development:
To do this game we have used Allegro in Codeblocks. Further, we used pointers, classes, references , among others.
This game has 7 classes in total and, as you can see, it also has another functions. We use allegro`s own functions to create, eliminate and load diferents kinds of game`s elements

Gameplay:
Here we have 3 basic elements which are: The rocket ship, enemies and a centipede. The player, that is represented by the small rocket ship,is at the bottom of the screen.  The player moves the character about the bottom area of the screen with a trackball and fires laser shots at a centipede ,with the key "D", advancing from the top of the screen down through a field of mushrooms. To move you will use the keys "Right, left, up, down" .Shooting any section of the centipede creates a mushroom; shooting one of the middle segments splits the centipede into two pieces at that point. Each piece then continues independently on its way down the board, with the first section of the rear piece becoming a new head. If the head is destroyed, the section behind it becomes the next head. The centipede starts at the top of the screen, traveling either left or right. When it hits a mushroom or the edge of the screen, it drops one level and switches direction. Thus, more mushrooms on the screen cause the centipede to descend more rapidly. The player can destroy mushrooms by shooting them, but each takes three hits to destroy. When all the centipede's segments are destroyed, a new centipede forms at the top of the screen. The player is also menaced by other creatures besides the centipedes. Fleas drop vertically, leaving additional mushrooms in their path; they appear when fewer than five mushrooms are in the player movement area, though the number required increases with level of difficulty. Spiders move across the player area in a zig-zag fashion and occasionally eat some of the mushrooms. Scorpions move horizontally across the screen and poison every mushroom they touch, but these never appear in the player movement region. A player loses a life when hit by a centipede or another enemy, such as a spider or a flea, after which any poisoned or partially damaged mushrooms revert to normal. Points are awarded for each regenerated mushroom. A game ends if all lives are gone.
